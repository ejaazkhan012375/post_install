# Note:  This NA template is 'based on' Global DB2 standard template 103_DB2_GLB_v2.2.0.txt
# Description: DB2 UDB
# Software products and versions: DB2 UDB v8, v9.x, V10.x
# Supported OS platforms: AIX, UNIX and LINUX
# local functional ID: db2*, <DB2_Instance_ID>
# local path changes: <DB2_Instance_Home> = xxx/xxx/xxx
# local product path changes: <DB2_Product_Path> = xxx/xxx/xxx 
# local OS groups for the Master: <inform_dba_group_here> 
#
# Version control
# V1.1 - jekri@dk.ibm.com - updated template layout with command aliases
#
# V1.1.1 - jekri@dk.ibm.com - minor update, the invalid character "-" 
#                            replaced with "_" in the User_Alias NAMES
#
# V1.1.2 - jekri@dk.ibm.com - corrected syntax error DB2_INSTALLER_PATH
#                             changed to IBM_DB2_INSTALLER_PATH
#
# V2.1 - jekri@dk.ibm.com - Added Cmnd_Alias IBM_DB2V10 for DB2 V10 
#                           and removed sudoedit commands
# -	sudoedit <:DB2_Product_Path>/V*/license/nodelock, \
# +Cmnd_Alias IBM_DB2V10= \ section, and command alias to authorized list.
# -	sudoedit <:DB2_Product_Path>/[!'..']*/profiles.reg, \
# -	sudoedit /opt/ibm/db2/[!'..']*/profiles.reg, \
#  NA V2.4 highc@us.ibm.com, dmullan@us.ibm.com 
#     Make consistent use of <:> placeholders.
#     Eliminate [!'..'] from -command- paths.
#  NA V2.4.1 highc@us.ibm.com, dmullan@us.ibm.com 
#     Align with recent 'standarization' updates from Global-specifically:
#     Eliminated IBM_DB2_ADM / su - root change window entry:  If a team 
#       requires this, will need to request an _ADJ per process.
#     IBM_DB2_SUGRP changed to: IBM_DB2_BAU_SUGRP
#     added '<:' and '>' to placeholders.
#     Updated product path placeholder names to include version specific
#       labels as will be needed by projected automations.
#     Changed /usr/bin/su to /bin/su, which works on Unix and Linux.
#     Added special instructions clarifying it is still permissible to 
#       remove stanza's and alias references for DB2 versions which
#       are not installed.
#     sudoedit /etc/services removed as global does not have this.
#     under DB2V9  changed    <:DB2_Instance_Home>/sqllib/adsm/dsmapipw, \
#                          to   <<:DB2V9_Product_Path>/*/adsm/dsmapipw, \
#     under DB2V10 added   <:DB2V10_Product_Path>/*/install/db2chgpath *,\
#     under DB2V10 added   <:DB2_installation_path>/db2prereqcheck, \
#  ALL NA V2.4.1 changes are standardization only, and have no 
#  functional nor security impact.

# Special instructions:  If only certain levels of DB2 installed, 
#    it is permissible to remove the 'stanzas' which assoicate to
#    levels you do not have installed.
#   If you do not use a 'master' file and wish to split this
#    into multiple files (one for each version) you may
#    eliminate the portion of the entries which are not for
#    the file's version.  You will need to rename
#    the templates as needed to reflect the customizations and
#    accomodate sudo library system(s) as needed.
#   If appropriate, you can introduce additional host_aliases for 
#    such as DB2V9_HOSTS and replace DB2_HOSTS
