#=====================================================================================
#
# Note:  It is -critical- that when you 'customize' 
#    IBM_yourAppName_BAU
#    IBM_yourAppName_ADM 
#    yourAppName_HOSTS
# below the names MUST match the user_alias and host_alias that aligns
# with the NA or GLB template you are adjusting.  It is equally important
# that the Cmd_Alias name -not- match exactly with the template you are
# adjusting, the Cmd_Alias name needs to be unique Vs any other
# Cmd_Alias being used.
# 
# <:Note- person developing this template ignores this line, this is
#   instruction for the 'sudo implementation team... and the _ADJ
#   owner can ajust this instruction to include any other directions
#   to the sudo implementation team>
