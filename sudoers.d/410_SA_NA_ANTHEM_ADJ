#        IBM_UNIX_SID_BAU user is to keep current script automation intact with NOPASSWD option. 
#	 IBM_UNIX_SA_ADM  user is only during authorized changes, MIDRANGE TECH SUPPORT team controls who is in ibmutil group
#	 		  and NOPASSWD option is used since some commands and scripts may break during a installtion process..
# 
# <:NA notes- rename this file to your application name, ensure you keep it a
#      'pure' unix text file, otherwise it may not work right when #included.
#      Recommend use of VIM to edit:  https://ibm.biz/NAsudoVim
#      Reminder when replacing 'yourAppName' below, use all CAPS, that is 
#      syntatically required by sudo. >

User_Alias    IBM_UNIX_SID_BAU = mrcoop,satuser
User_Alias    IBM_UNIX_SA_ADM = %ibmutil
#    SA_HOSTS
# below the names MUST match the user_alias and host_alias that aligns
# with the NA or GLB template you are adjusting.  It is equally important
# that the Cmnd_Alias name -not- match exactly with the template you are
# adjusting, the Cmnd_Alias name needs to be unique Vs any other
# Cmd_Alias being used.
