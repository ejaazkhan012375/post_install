# defaults:
#
#     polling_interval   : The interval between two path checks in seconds.
#
#     failback           : The failback policy should be set to "immediate"
#                          to have automatic failback, i.e. if a higher
#                          priority path that previously failed is restored,
#                          I/O automatically and immediately fails back to
#                          the preferred path.
#
#    no_path_retry       : Use this setting in order to deal with transient
#                          total path failure scenarios. Indicates that the if
#                          all paths are failed for 10 checks (iterations of
#                          the checkerloop) then will set the device to
#                          .fail_if_no_path. so that I/O will not stay queued
#                          forever and I/O errors are returned back to the
#                          application. This value should be adjusted based on
#                          the value of the polling_interval. Basically, with a
#                          larger polling_interval, this means that the amount
#                          of time of allowed total path failure will be
#                          longer, since the tolerance time is
#                          (no_path_retry * polling_interval) seconds.
#                          SHOULD NOT BE USED WITH .features..
#
#    rr_min_io           : The number of IOs to route to a path before switching
#                          to the next path in the same path group
#
#    path_checker        : The default 'readsector0' path checker uses SCSI
#                          READ (opcode 0x28) which doesn't work in clustered
#                          environments. TUR (Test Unit Ready) does work in
#                          clustered environments with storage that subscribes
#                          to the SCSI-3 spec.
#
#    user_friendly_names : With this value set to .yes., DM MPIO devices will
#                          be named as .mpath0., .mpath1., .mpath2., etc. ...
#                          The /var/lib/mulitpath/bindings file is
#                          automatically generated, mapping the .mpathX. name
#                          to the wwid of the LUN. If set to "no", use the
#                          WWID as the alias. In either case this be will be
#                          overriden by any specific aliases in this file.

## The wwid line in the following blacklist section is shown as an example
## of how to blacklist devices by wwid.  The 3 devnode lines are the
## compiled in default blacklist. If you want to blacklist entire types
## of devices, such as all scsi devices, you should use a devnode line.
## However, if you want to blacklist specific devices, you should use
## a wwid line.  Since there is no guarantee that a specific device will
## not change names on reboot (from /dev/sda to /dev/sdb for example)
## devnode lines are not recommended for blacklisting specific devices.
